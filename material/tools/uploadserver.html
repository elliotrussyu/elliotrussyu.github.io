<p>You need to make sure that your device running this server application is in the same network as the intended clients. Just specify the port and click on start server, then a server URL is being displayed such that the client can just open that url in the web browser and upload their files. The client will get a notification when the file is successfully being uploaded on the client's page. You may find the uploaded files in the directory where you put your server application, there will be a folder named "uploads" created for all uploaded files. When you would like to stop server just click stop server button. </p>
