<h2>Lecture Note: Classical Control Systems</h2>
<p>This lecture note is written with a specific intention for the undergraduate course: <em>Basic Control Systems</em> in Shanghai Maritime University(上海海事大学). But I think it would be helpful to share this lecture note on my website such that a wider group of readers can benefit from this piece of work. If you have suggestions or found a mistake, you can discover my email address on the front page.</p>
<p>The main parts of this lecture note is written for students with some experience with undergraduate level <em>calculus, ordinary differential equations, complex analysis, integral transform, Newtonian mechanics, circuit analysis. </em>. In case some terms look unfamiliar to you, some supplementary sections will be compiled but that's of the low priority of my current work.</p>
<p>All sections in pdf format will be released here on this webpage.</p>
<p><a href="BCS_pt1.pdf">Part 1| Fundamental Concepts: Control Systems</a></p>
<p>Part 2| ODEs and Physical Systems</p>
<p>Part 3| Analyzing Transfer Functions</p>
<p>Part 4| Closed-loop Gains and PID Control</p>
<p>Part 5| Frequency Domain Analysis</p>
<p>------------</p>
<p>Recap: Calculus</p>
<p>Recap: ODE</p>
<p>Recap: Integral Transform</p>
<p>Recap: Complex Analysis</p>
