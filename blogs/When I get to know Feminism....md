# When I get to Know Feminism...

### BEFORE the main text

I often find artists, writers, movie makers and even philosophers are quite useless in an instantaneous manner, especially in today's world where there is less freedom and less ability to think actually. Such people point problems, record the emotions and sparks in their brains, display the truth, re-make or distort the truth. However, there is no instantaneous influence because their work must not go beyond some "red-line" settle by the human beings in possession of power. Through the observation from my naive open eyes, even short-term influence is very rare. And they almost never provide a solution.

I do not like it.

But I do think these people and their works are necessary. I like to solve the scientific problems but this short, naive piece of text is merely acting as a recording tape of my brain. I am only an unborn infant in the fields of mathematics, social science and philosophy. While I might be attacking and contradicting myself in the future, but this(these) text at least genuinely records the thought process.

### MAIN 

What feminism have always confuses me is that its lack of a standard definition of common recognition. It is full of terms and ad-hoc facts but missing the links in the middle. It is more like that in mathematics, you have a theorem about a property of an infinite set, by running simulations for a (perhaps very large) finite number of cycles and the observed results match with the properties. But when I seek hard enough for a proof, I can not really find it apart from the simulations. 

For those who know nothing about mathematics, an infinite set is the collection of infinite number of elements, like counting all numbers which you can never finish counting even if you start from zero and ignore the negative ones and decimals. 

But for those who indeed know a bit more about mathematics, we know that our math has been built from the axioms, to be precise, the Peano axioms in number theory and Zermelo–Fraenkel with the axiom of Choice(ZFC) or von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel(NBG) in the field of set theory.

Then I have read about, the defining feminism
